# Real Analysis

## What is this?
These are my notes and proofs from self-studying real analysis. 

## Why are you doing this?
I am taking a topology course this coming semester, but I didn't feel like taking Real Analysis I (which is actually a pre-requisite for Topology I). In an attempt not to die from taking this class without proper pre-reqs, I am trying to give myself a crash course in real analysis instead. As such, I am only doing chapters 1, 2, 7, 8, and 9. 

This was actually all @Nathan-Huckleberry 's idea, because he is infinitely more responsible than I am.

## Where did you get the textbook from?
